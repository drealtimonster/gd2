    <p>Eventually I have to do it, I can't avoid it forever.<br />
        I have less than three hours to sta...finish my project<br />
        LET'S GET IT?<br />
        It's hard to get pumped up about homework.<br />
        There's a saying around here.<br />
        Spread by me to anyone willing to listen.<br /> 
        "Rely on Your Clutchness Like it is a Crutch."<br />
        I live by these words.<br />
        I die by these words.
